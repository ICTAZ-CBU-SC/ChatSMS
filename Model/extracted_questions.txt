Cells from two positions in the stem are also shown.
position X
cell from position X
position Y
light
cell from position Y

one shown from position Y.
(a) Cells at positions X and Y differ in size and shape.
Give two other differences between these cells.
(b) Explain how the movement of water molecules is involved in this increase in cell size.

Name this response and explain how auxin and cell elongation are involved.

(ii) It is thought that myopia is the result of a combination of genetic and environmental

It has been suggested that the changing percentages of people with myopia is a result of
changes in human activities.
Suggest a change in human activity and how it could make a person less able to
see far-away objects clearly.
(c) Iris colour is genetically determined. The allele for blue colour, b, is recessive to the allele for
